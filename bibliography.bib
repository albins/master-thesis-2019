	abstract = {Rust is a new programming language for developing reliable and efficient systems. It is designed to support concurrency and parallelism in building applications and libraries that take full advantage of modern hardware. Rust's static type system is safe1 and expressive and provides strong guarantees about isolation, concurrency, and memory safety. Rust also offers a clear performance model, making it easier to predict and reason about program efficiency. One important way it accomplishes this is by allowing fine-grained control over memory representations, with direct support for stack allocation and contiguous record storage. The language balances such controls with the absolute requirement for safety: Rust's type system and runtime guarantee the absence of data races, buffer overflows, stack overflows, and accesses to uninitialized or deallocated memory.},

	abstract = {We introduce a type system based on intervals, objects representing the time in which a block of code will execute. The type system can verify time-based properties such as when a field will be accessed or a method will be invoked. One concrete application of our type system is data-race protection: For fields which are initialized during one phase of the program and constant thereafter, users can designate the interval during which the field is mutable. Code which happens after this initialization interval can safely read the field in parallel. We also support fields guarded by a lock and even the use of dynamic race detectors. Another use for intervals is to designate different phases in the object's lifetime, such as a constructor phase. The type system then ensures that only appropriate methods are invoked in each phase.},

	shorttitle = {Leapfrog Triejoin},
	abstract = {Recent years have seen exciting developments in join algorithms. In 2008, Atserias, Grohe and Marx (henceforth {AGM}) proved a tight bound on the maximum result size of a full conjunctive query, given constraints on the input relation sizes. In 2012, Ngo, Porat, R«e and Rudra (henceforth {NPRR}) devised a join algorithm with worst-case running time proportional to the {AGM} bound [8]. Our commercial database system {LogicBlox} employs a novel join algorithm, leapfrog triejoin, which compared conspicuously well to the {NPRR} algorithm in preliminary benchmarks. This spurred us to analyze the complexity of leapfrog triejoin. In this paper we establish that leapfrog triejoin is also worst-case optimal, up to a log factor, in the sense of {NPRR}. We improve on the results of {NPRR} by proving that leapfrog triejoin achieves worst-case optimality for ﬁner-grained classes of database instances, such as those deﬁned by constraints on projection cardinalities. We show that {NPRR} is not worstcase optimal for such classes, giving a counterexample where leapfrog triejoin runs in O(n log n) time and {NPRR} runs in Θ(n1.375) time. On a practical note, leapfrog triejoin can be implemented using conventional data structures such as B-trees, and extends naturally to ∃1 queries. We believe our algorithm offers a useful addition to the existing toolbox of join algorithms, being easy to absorb, simple to implement, and having a concise optimality proof.},
